# App Review Resolution Center Reply (4.3(b) + 5.1.1(v))

Hello App Review Team,

Thank you for the review. We addressed both issues in this submission.

## Guideline 4.3(b) - Spam
This build is no longer a horoscope-only experience. We added a new feature tab called **Rituel** (Rituel Kocu) with a behavior-driven daily coaching loop:

1. User sets a weekly goal.
2. User selects a focus area (Career / Relationship / Health / Finance).
3. App generates a personalized daily 3-step action plan based on zodiac + goal + focus.
4. User completes tasks via interactive checklist.
5. User tracks daily energy (1-5 stars) and writes reflection notes.
6. App calculates a measurable alignment score and shows a 7-day trend.

Navigation path:
- Open app
- Bottom tab bar -> **Rituel**
- Enter weekly goal -> choose focus -> tap **Bugunun Planini Olustur**

## Guideline 5.1.1(v) - Account Deletion
We added in-app permanent account deletion.

Navigation path:
- **Profil -> Hesabi Sil**

From this flow, user account and related personal data are deleted permanently. This does not require contacting support.

If needed, we can provide a short screen recording of the exact paths above.
