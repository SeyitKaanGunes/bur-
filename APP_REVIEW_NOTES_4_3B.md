# App Store Resubmission Notes (Guideline 4.3(b))

This version is not a horoscope-only content app anymore.  
We added a new behavior-driven feature called **Rituel Kocu** that turns astrology into an actionable daily coaching workflow.

## Where to find it

1. Open app
2. Bottom tab bar -> **Rituel**
3. Create a weekly goal
4. Choose a focus area (Career / Relationship / Health / Finance)
5. Tap **Bugunun Planini Olustur**

## What is unique in this flow

- Generates a personalized daily 3-step action plan tied to user zodiac + goal + focus area
- Users complete tasks (interactive checklist, not static content)
- Users track daily energy state (1-5 stars)
- Users write daily reflection notes (journal style)
- App computes a **Kozmik Uyum Skoru** from behavior and mood
- App shows 7-day alignment trend for self-improvement continuity
- Data persists on device, enabling habit/progress tracking over time

## Why this is different from saturated horoscope apps

- Core loop is **goal coaching + execution + reflection + measurable progress**
- Horoscope content is now supporting context, not the primary standalone product
- The app creates a repeatable personal practice system instead of only displaying generic readings

## Account deletion note (Guideline 5.1.1(v))

Also addressed in this build:

Path: **Profil -> Hesabi Sil**  
Account and related personal data can be deleted permanently from within the app.
